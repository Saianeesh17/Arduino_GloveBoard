# Arduino_GloveBoard
 
Instructions to run the program:
1. Clone the code into your Arduino IDE
2. Build the circuit using the following concepts (first image: how to set up photoresistors, second image: how to set up the buzzer)

3. Change the code as required to use the appropriate analog and digital pins depending
4. Attach the photoresistors to the fingertips of the glove and change the code to play different codes corresponding to the finger
5. Flash and run the program on the Arduino
